Using Variables:-

Valid variable names:-  foo, foo_env, foo_port, foo5, _foo

Not valid:- *foo, foo-port, foo port, foo.port, 5foo,12

1) Simple variables:-
You can define a simple variable using standard YAML syntax. For example:

    remote_install_path: /opt/my_app_config

Referencing simple variables
After you define a variable, use Jinja2 syntax to reference it. Jinja2 variables use double curly braces.

    - hosts: app_servers
      vars:
       app_path: "{{ remote_install_path }}"


2) List variables:-
A list variable combines a variable name with multiple values. The multiple values can be stored as an itemized list or in square brackets [], separated with commas.

Defining variables as lists
You can define variables with multiple values using YAML lists. For example:


   region:
    - northeast
    - southeast
    - midwest

Referencing list variables
When you use variables defined as a list (also called an array), you can use individual, specific fields from that list. 
The first item in a list is item 0, the second item is item 1. For example:

     region: "{{ region[0] }}"
The value of this expression would be “northeast”.
