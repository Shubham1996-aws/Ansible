1) Creating Encrypted Files:-
To create a new encrypted data file, run the following command:

               ansible-vault create foo.yml

First you will be prompted for a password. After providing a password, the tool will launch whatever editor you have defined with $EDITOR, and defaults to vi. 
Once you are done with the editor session, the file will be saved as encrypted data.

2) Editing Encrypted Files:-
To edit an encrypted file in place, use the ansible-vault edit command. 
This command will decrypt the file to a temporary file and allow you to edit the file, saving it back when done and removing the temporary file:

               ansible-vault edit foo.yml

3) Rekeying Encrypted Files:-
Should you wish to change your password on a vault-encrypted file or files, you can do so with the rekey command:

                ansible-vault rekey foo.yml

This command will help you to set the new password for the foo.yml file.

4) Encrypting Unencrypted Files:-
   
            ansible-vault encrypt foo.yml

If you have existing files that you wish to encrypt, use the ansible-vault encrypt command.

5) Decrypting Encrypted Files:-
If you have existing files that you no longer want to keep encrypted, you can permanently decrypt them by running the ansible-vault decrypt command.

           ansible-vault decrypt foo.yml

6) Viewing Encrypted Files:-
If you want to view the contents of an encrypted file without editing it, you can use the ansible-vault view command:
   
           ansible-vault view foo.yml

7) Providing Vault Passwords:-
When all data is encrypted using a single password the --ask-vault-pass or --vault-password-file cli options should be used.

For example, to use a password store in the text file /path/to/my/vault-password-file:
              ansible-playbook --vault-password-file /path/to/my/vault-password-file site.yml

To prompt for a password:

            ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass site.yml

To get the password from a vault password executable script my-vault-password.py:

               ansible-playbook --vault-password-file my-vault-password.py
